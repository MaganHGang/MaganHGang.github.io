				<h1 align = "center"> About Me </h1>
				<p align = "justify"> 
					Computers have always fascinated me since I was introduced to computer games consoles and online games. Therefore it has been my ambition to pursue a career in the computing industry. Whenever I am on the internet I always like to update myself with the latest information about computers and technology, especially latest gadgets, games and computers.  I like multimedia as well and it’s fascinating learn about how computers translate images, sound and video.
				</p>	
				<p align = "justify"> I particularly have an interest in multimedia topics such as Web Development and graphics. I have participated in web projects over the past 2 years (have a look at my CV & Portfolio page for more details) in university. I really enjoyed studying about the web and it really improved my skill at it. Whenever I’m away from studies, I like watching anime and playing games. I also love to learn about my religion, Islam.
